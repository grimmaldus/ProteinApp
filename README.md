# ProteinApp
This is only a demo app of subsurface scattering. 
# Controls
1) Loading protein: Drag 'n' Drop pdb file onto application window. 
2) Menu on the side:  
	Show thickness - Turn on/off it's an abs distance of (dIn(incident light) - dOut(outgoing light))
	Strength - Controls strength of given thickness
	Technique - Different computational techniques for debugging purpose
	
	Lighting - Drop menu with lighting models of Subsurface Scattering 
	Show only Transmittance - Shows only transmittance function T(s)
	Extinction coeficient - Controls intensity of attenuation of ligh wihin the object.
